# FutureDiff Task 130 Documentation

## Rollback drill assurance

Added deterministic rollback-path completeness and restored-state checks for every migration and deployment step.

## Validation

- Covered by `tests/test_operations.py`;
- executed by `scripts/operations-assurance.sh`;
- included in `scripts/validate-overlay.sh`;
- produces machine-readable, digest-bound evidence where applicable.

## Safety boundary

This task contributes local operational assurance only. It does not substitute for canonical-repository merge validation or real external runtime, provider, hosted-platform, and production-like load evidence.
